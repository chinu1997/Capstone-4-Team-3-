Extraction/identification of major topics &amp; themes discussed in news articles.
In this project our task is to identify major themes/topics across a collection of BBC news articles. You can use clustering algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) etc.
The dataset contains a set of news articles for each major segment consisting of business, entertainment, politics, sports and technology. You need to create an aggregate dataset of all the news articles and perform topic modeling on this dataset. Verify whether these topics correspond to the different tags available.
The main aim of this problem is to present the results of different experiments focused on the problem of model fitting process in topic modeling and its accuracy when applied to long texts. At the same time, in fact, the digital era has made available both enormous quantities of textual data and technological advances that have facilitated the development of techniques to automate the data coding and analysis processes.
